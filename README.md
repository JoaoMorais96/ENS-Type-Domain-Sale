## Info: 

The contracts can be directly imported on Remix:
- ERC20Creation : 0x12aCa96a069D8894aA753ab8797E9c9f162715eF
- ServerNameStore : 0x39Cf8B6152596E2204078E91bB66626897db2993

As there is no front end, you need to call the "approve" function on the ERC20Creation with a certain amount (>= to what you are going to spend in ServerNameStore) before you can buy a domain. Example: approve("0x2D79Dd7E88139c2ebeff132e80bE4FD77De3101b", 10);
